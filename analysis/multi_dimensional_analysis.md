### Extended Scenario and Multi-dimensional Analysis:

1. **Geo-Political Dimension (within Situation Assessment):**
    - **Knowledge Sources:** Regional Tensions, Political Alliances, Historical Conflicts, Economic Interests, Diplomatic Communications.
    - **Application:** Understanding the broader geopolitical context can affect how a naval contact is assessed. For example, if the "Regional Tensions" frame indicates high tension with a particular nation, a sonar contact might be more readily classified as a threat.
    - **Lines of Thought:** These might include pathways like `Historical Conflicts/Last War/Navy Engagement → Identified Contacts/Type/Hostile`.

2. **Technological Dimension (across all levels):**
    - **Knowledge Sources:** Sensor Capabilities, Communication Systems, Weapon Tech, Cybersecurity, Navigation Systems.
    - **Application:** This dimension deals with the technological aspects of the situation. For instance, in the Data Fusion cloud, the "Sensor Capabilities" frame can influence how data is interpreted.
    - **Lines of Thought:** `Sensor Capabilities/Sonar/Range → Sonar Data/Contact Distance/500 meters`.

3. **Environmental Dimension (primarily in Data Fusion):**
    - **Knowledge Sources:** Oceanographic Data, Weather Patterns, Marine Life, Underwater Terrain, Environmental Regulations.
    - **Application:** Environmental factors play a critical role in data interpretation. For example, certain marine life activities detected by sonar might be mistaken for enemy submarines.
    - **Lines of Thought:** `Oceanographic Data/Currents/Strong → Sonar Data/False Contact/Marine Life`.

4. **Human Factor Dimension (across all levels):**
    - **Knowledge Sources:** Crew Fatigue, Decision Making Styles, Training Levels, Morale, Communication Styles.
    - **Application:** This dimension assesses the human factor in decision-making and operations. For example, "Crew Fatigue" might impact the efficiency of data processing or decision accuracy.
    - **Lines of Thought:** `Crew Fatigue/High → Decision Making Styles/Conservative`.

5. **Strategic Dimension (primarily in Resource Allocation):**
    - **Knowledge Sources:** Long-term Objectives, Resource Management, Strategic Partnerships, Future Operations, Reconnaissance Plans.
    - **Application:** Strategic planning frames influence resource allocation and longer-term responses to contacts.
    - **Lines of Thought:** `Strategic Partnerships/Ally Nearby → Response Plans/Coordinate`.
