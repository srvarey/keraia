"role": "assistant",        "content": "Based on the pump fault manual you've provided, we will 
create a set of frames to encapsulate facts about the pump's warning, fault, auto-reset behavior, 
and corrective actions. Then we'll construct a procedural reasoning script that follows the 
grammar you've shared.

### Suggested Frames

1. **Warning Frame:**
   
   FACT PumpWarningCode [ 
       'code': 10, 
       'description': 'Pump communication fault'
   ] 
   

2. **Fault Frame:**
   
   FACT PumpFault [
       'type': 'CommunicationFault',
       'description': 'Communication fault between different parts of the electronics.'
   ] 
   

3. **Auto-reset Behavior Frame:**
   
   FACT PumpAutoReset [
       'enabled': true,
       'description': 'The pump has auto-reset capabilities.'
   ] 
   

4. **Corrective Actions Frame:**
   
   FACT PumpCorrectiveActions [
       'actions': [
           'Replace the pump',
           'Call service for assistance',
           'Check if the pump is running in turbine operation',
           'See code (EFP) Forced pumping'
       ]
   ] 
   

### Procedural Reasoning Script

Now we'll write a procedural reasoning script that defines goals and procedures based on 
the given facts about the pump.



{
    GOALS: 
        ACHIEVE ResolvePumpFault:PumpCommunicationFault ;

    FACTS: 
        FACT PumpWarningCode ['code': 10, 'description': 'Pump communication fault'] ;
        FACT PumpFault ['type': 'CommunicationFault', 'description': 'Communication 
        fault between different parts of the electronics.'] ;
        FACT PumpAutoReset ['enabled': true, 'description': 'The pump has auto-reset 
        capabilities.'] ;
        FACT PumpCorrectiveActions ['actions': ['Replace the pump', 'Call service 
        for assistance', 'Check if the pump is running in turbine operation', 
        'See code (EFP) Forced pumping']] ;

    PLAN: {
        NAME: ResolvePumpFaultPlan ;

        DOCUMENTATION: 
            \"A plan to resolve the pump communication fault by either auto-reset or 
            taking corrective actions if needed.\" ;

        GOAL: 
            ACHIEVE ResolvePumpFault ;

        CONTEXT: 
            FACT PumpWarningCode ['code': 10] ;

        PRECONDITION: 
            FACT PumpFault ['type': 'CommunicationFault'] ;

        BODY: 
            WAIT: ExecAction.CheckAutoReset ;  // Check if auto-reset is enabled
            IF ExecAction.CheckAutoReset THEN 
                'EXECUTE' ResetPump 'based on auto-reset' ;
            ELSE
                FOR action IN PumpCorrectiveActions.actions DO
                    'EXECUTE' action ;  // Execute each corrective action in case of failure
                END DO;
            END IF;
        };
    };
}


### Explanation of the Script
- **GOALS**: The goal is to resolve the pump's communication fault.
- **FACTS**: Various facts about the pump, including the warning code, fault details, 
auto-reset status, and corrective actions.
- **PLAN**: A structured plan that includes a context that checks for the warning, 
precondition for the fault, and the main body that decides what to do based on whether 
auto-reset is enabled.
- **BODY**: The body contains a decision structure that waits for an auto-reset check 
and executes corrective actions if the auto-reset is not successful.
