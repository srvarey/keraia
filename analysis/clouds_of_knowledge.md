## KLines and Lines of Thought (LoT)

### KLines: Monitoring Water Quality

* *WaterTreatmentSystem/WaterQuality/pH/CurrentValue*
* *WaterTreatmentSystem/Turbidity/CurrentValue*

`WaterTreatmentSystem/WaterQuality/pH/CurrentValue` accesses the current pH level in the water treatment system, crucial for verifying that it remains within the ideal range.

`WaterTreatmentSystem/Turbidity/CurrentValue` moves on to check the turbidity level, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum acceptable limit.

---

### KLines: Pump Operational Status and Fault Management

* *WaterTreatmentSystem/PumpStatus/Operational/Efficiency*
* *WaterTreatmentSystem/PumpStatus/FaultCodes/Code2*

`WaterTreatmentSystem/PumpStatus/Operational/Efficiency`: Retrieves the efficiency of the pump to assess whether it is operating at or above the desired threshold.

`WaterTreatmentSystem/PumpStatus/FaultCodes/Code2`: Checks for specific fault codes related to the pump, particularly focusing on issues like overheating, with linked solutions.

The use of KLines as opposed to atomic facts in a rule-based system offers several advantages, especially in complex environments where interactions between different knowledge sources are essential for intelligent decision-making. Hereâ€™s why and how using KLines can be more effective:
