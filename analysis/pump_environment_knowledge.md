Frames:
    Frame for Pump Overheating:
        Slots: Location (corner of a building), 
               Adjacency (near another building), 
               Ventilation (blocked by rubbish)
    Frame for Electrolysis System Issue:
        Slots: System Type (SES for electric chlorination), 
               Location (Balmoral, Scotland), 
               Problem (gassing column dropping)

Rules:
    Rule for Pump Overheating:
        IF 
        pump's location is poorly ventilated AND external blockage is detected 
        THEN 
        initiate environmental hazard assessment.
    Rule for Electrolysis System:
        IF air block in airline is detected THEN check for maintenance issues 
        related to SES unit.

Procedural Reasoning Script:
    For Handling Overheating:
        Check environmental factors (like sunlight exposure, room temperature)
        Assess ventilation and clear blockages
        Monitor temperature and adjust system operation accordingly

Cause-Effect Klines:
    Kline for Pump Overheating:
        Environmental_Blockage -> Reduced_Ventilation -> Pump_Overheating
    Kline for Electrolysis System Issue:
        Air_Block -> Gassing_Column_Drop -> System_Malfunction

Anomaly Detection:
    Pump Overheating:
        Anomaly: Unusual temperature rise
        Data Points: Room temperature, ventilation status, 
                     pump operation history
    Electrolysis System Issue:
        Anomaly: Unexpected change in gassing column
        Data Points: Column position data, air pressure readings, 
                     maintenance logs
