### Validate Engineer's Credentials (Explanation-Based Reasoning)

```
Function: ValidateEngineersCredentials
Input: EngineerID (string), CredentialRecords (list of records)
Output: ValidationResult (boolean), Reason (string)

Begin
  For each record in CredentialRecords
    If record.EngineerID == EngineerID
      If record.Status == "Valid"
        Return True, "Credentials validated successfully."
      Else
        Return False, "Credentials are invalid or expired."
  EndFor
  Return False, "EngineerID not found in records."
End
```

This step uses explanation-based reasoning to verify if the engineer's credentials are listed and valid within the system's records. The input is the EngineerID and a list of credential records. The output determines the validation status and provides a reason for the decision.

### Automatic Reset and Restart (Forward Chaining)

```
Function: AutomaticResetAndRestart
Input: PumpStatus (dictionary with keys 'isBlocked', 'electricalStatus')
Output: ResetStatus (boolean), Message (string)

Begin
  If PumpStatus['isBlocked'] == True or 
     PumpStatus['electricalStatus'] != "Connected"
    Execute SystemReset()
    Execute SystemRestart()
    If PumpStatus after actions == Operational
      Return True, "Pump reset and restart successful."
    Else
      Return False, "Pump remains non-operational after reset and restart."
  Else
    Return False, "Conditions for automatic reset not met."
End
```

Leveraging forward chaining, this function assesses the pump's status and decides to initiate a reset and restart if conditions are met. The decision is based on whether the pump is blocked or not properly connected. The output reflects the success of the operation and a message detailing the pump's operational status.

### Contact Service Center (Causal Reasoning)

```
Function: ContactServiceCenter
Input: AbilityToResolve (boolean)
Output: NextSteps (string)

Begin
  If AbilityToResolve == False
    Return "Advise contacting the WTS service center for further assistance."
  Else
    Return "Proceed with further diagnostic steps."
End
```

Utilizing causal reasoning, this function advises the next course of action based on the engineer's ability to resolve the issue at hand. If the engineer is unable to proceed with manual interventions, the recommended next step is to seek professional assistance.

### Check For Foreign Objects (Procedural Reasoning)

```
Function: CheckForForeignObjects
Input: InspectionReport (string)
Output: ForeignObjectsFound (boolean), Advisory (string)

Begin
  If contains(InspectionReport, "foreign objects detected")
    Return True, "Foreign objects detected; advise removal."
  Else
    Return False, "No foreign objects detected; proceed with 
    standard maintenance."
End
```

Through procedural reasoning, this function analyzes the inspection report for mentions of foreign objects. Depending on the findings, it either advises removal of the objects or suggests continuing with normal maintenance procedures.

### Object Removal Procedure (Anomaly Detection)

```
Function: ObjectRemovalProcedure
Input: ForeignObjectDetails (list of strings)
Output: RemovalStatus (boolean), DetailedActions (list of strings)

Begin
  Actions = []
  For each object in ForeignObjectDetails
    Actions.append("Locate and remove " + object)
  EndFor
  If Actions is not empty
    Return True, Actions
  Else
    Return False, ["No specific actions needed."]
End
```

Applying anomaly detection, this function crafts a tailored procedure for removing detected foreign objects based on their characteristics. It outputs a status indicating whether specific actions are needed and a list of detailed actions for removal.

### Dismantle and Reassemble Guide (Reasoning by Analogy)

```
Function: DismantleAndReassemble
Input: FaultCode (integer), HistoricalFaults (dictionary)
Output: StepsToTake (list of strings)

Begin
  Steps = HistoricalFaults.get(FaultCode, "default")
  If Steps == "default"
    Return ["Disconnect power", "Dismantle pump", "Check and clean 
            components", "Reassemble pump", "Reconnect power"]
  Else
    Return Steps
End
```

Utilizing reasoning by analogy, this function identifies the appropriate set of steps to dismantle and reassemble the pump by comparing the current fault code against
 historical data of resolved faults. It outputs a specific or default set of procedural steps.
