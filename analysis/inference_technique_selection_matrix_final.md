# Inference Technique Selection Matrix

| **Inference Paradigm**            | **Characteristics and Suggested Problem Types** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Forward Chaining**             | - Best for problems where a clear set of rules can lead to a conclusion.  <br> - Suitable for situations where all necessary information is available upfront.  <br> - Ideal for generating possible consequences from a given set of facts. |
| **Procedural Reasoning**         | - Applies when tasks need a series of steps (procedure) to solve.  <br> - Useful for problems requiring sequential actions.  <br> - Effective in scenarios where procedures are well-defined for given situations. |
| **Causal Reasoning**             | - Optimal for understanding cause-effect relationships.  <br> - Suitable for diagnosing problems or explaining why certain events occur.  <br> - Beneficial in situations where intervention can prevent or produce specific outcomes. |
| **Explanation-Based Reasoning**  | - Useful for problems where understanding or learning from specific examples is needed.  <br> - Ideal when prior knowledge can explain why a solution is correct.  <br> - Best applied to scenarios requiring justification or rationale for decisions. |
| **Reasoning by Analogy**         | - Applies to problems that can be solved by drawing parallels to similar, previously solved problems.  <br> - Effective when direct solutions are not apparent, but similar cases exist.  <br> - Suitable for creative problem solving and innovative solutions. |
| **Anomaly Detection**            | - Best for identifying patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.  <br> - Useful in monitoring and surveillance tasks.  <br> - Appropriate for problems requiring the identification of outliers or exceptions. |
