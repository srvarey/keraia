Situation_Element_Perception_Refinement     
     Description         Focuses on improving the accuracy and clarity of perceived situational 
                         elements. The goal is to ensure that what's observed or received is a 
                         true representation of the actual situation   
                    
    Existence_Size_Analysis         
       Description       To meticulously evaluate the presence and magnitude of specific 
                         components or entities in a given situation. In a rapidly evolving 
                         scenario, it's imperative not only to discern which elements are 
                         present, but also to gauge the scale or extent of their involvement

    Identity_Analysis          
        Description      zeroes in on accurately identifying and categorizing each individual 
                         component or entity present in the given situation. The objective here 
                         isn't just to recognize the existence of elements but to distinctly 
                         discern their specific types, models, or classifications.

    Kinematics_Analysis       
        Description      focuses on the analysis of movement characteristics of the entity, 
                         specifically its speed, direction, and changes in altitude
