- Rule: If Pump Flow Rate is below 1500 gpm, then there may be a 
        blockage in the pump or the discharge line.
        
- Rule: If Pump Motor Current is higher than 15 amps, then there 
        may be a mechanical or electrical issue with the motor.
        
- Rule: If Pump Vibration exceeds 0.15 ips, then there  may   be 
        misalignment or wear in the pump components.
        
- Rule: If Pump Discharge Pressure is  significantly lower  than 
        120 psi, then there may be a leak or restriction in the 
        discharge line.
        
- Rule: If Pump Temperature  is  abnormally  high ( >60  degrees 
        Celsius), then there may be a problem with the  cooling 
        system or excessive friction in the pump.
        
- Rule: If Pump Inlet Pressure is below 30  psi, then there  may 
         be a blockage or air leakage in the suction line.
         
- Rule: If Pump Efficiency has decreased  below 80%, then  there 
        may be wear in the impeller or reduced pump performance.
        
- Rule: If  Pump   Suction  Line  is  partially   clogged ( >10% 
        clogging),   then  there  may  be  reduced flow rate or 
        cavitation issues.
        
- Rule: If Pump Impeller is damaged or worn, then  there may  be 
        reduced pump efficiency and increased vibration.
        
- Rule: If Pump  Motor  is  producing  grinding  noise with high 
        intensity,  then there  may be  bearing   or  mechanical 
        problems in the motor or pump assembly.
