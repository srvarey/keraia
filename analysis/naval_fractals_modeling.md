## Convocation Fractals: Dynamic Decision-making Structure

- **Original Formula:**  
  ```
  C(n) = C(n - 1) + ΔI(n)
  ```

- **Naval Example:**  
  Let's replace `C(n)` with `D(n)`, representing the decision-making process at level `n` in the naval hierarchy. `ΔI(n)` becomes `ΔD(n)`, the incremental decision input from the previous level. Thus, decisions at each level are influenced by and influence decisions at other levels, mimicking the fractal structure of decision-making in a complex organizational structure.

## Knowledge Source Fractals: Information Distribution

- **Original Formula:**  
  ```
  K(h) = ∑[i=1 to S] K(h - 1)_i
  ```

- **Naval Example:**  
  Replace `K(h)` with `I(h)`, indicating the information at hierarchical level `h`. `S` is the number of subordinate units or sources at this level. This formula models how information is processed and distributed across the naval hierarchy, reflecting the self-similar pattern of communication flow, where each unit acts both as a receiver and a transmitter of information.

These formulas underscore the fractal approach's potential for modeling complex systems by capturing the recursive, hierarchical nature of knowledge and interactions, contrasting with the more flat and uniform structure of traditional neural networks.
