# Blocked Pump Diagnosis and Troubleshooting

```java
/*
HYPOTHESIS:
    The pump is blocked

EVIDENCE:
    Sensor
    High temperature
    Current
    Vibration
    Flow : low
    Physical
    Hot : Using thermometer check temperature (IR)
    Noise : Abnormal
    Environment
    Can Water source be checked
    Contamination in water source of product that shouldnâ€™t be there. (e.g. oil)

RISK MITIGATION

ASSUMPTION:
    Utilize evidence from inbuilt sensors
    Human interaction forms clarification (sensors touch, sight, smell)
    WTS only using chatbot for our service engineers
    Suitably experienced
    Pump solutions only
    Exit is callWTS expert knowledge
