## 1. Inference Transformation for Capability_Profiles

```java
Function: createCapabilityProfiles
Input: identityAnalysis (Knowledge Source)
Output: capabilityProfiles (Knowledge Source)

1. Initialize capabilityProfiles with the type "Capability_Profiles"
2. Retrieve objectType from identityAnalysis
3. If objectType is "Submarine":
      Set weapons to "Torpedoes"
      Set stealth to "Low Radar Cross-section"
      Set ewCapabilities to "Advanced ECM Systems"
   Else:
      Set weapons to "Anti-ship Missiles"
      Set stealth to "None"
      Set ewCapabilities to "Basic ECM Systems"
4. Add "Weapon Systems", "Stealth Features", "Electronic Warfare Capabilities" to capabilityProfiles
5. Return capabilityProfiles

Implementation Approach:
- Use polymorphism to handle different object types effectively.
- Consider implementing a strategy pattern for weapon systems, stealth features, and electronic warfare capabilities based on the type of vessel or object detected.
```

## 2. Classification Transformation for Operational_Roles

```java
Function: createOperationalRoles
Input: kinematicsAnalysis (Knowledge Source)
Output: operationalRoles (Knowledge Source)

1. Initialize operationalRoles with the type "Operational_Roles"
2. Retrieve speed from kinematicsAnalysis
3. Determine primaryRole based on speed:
   If speed > 30 knots:
      primaryRole = "Direct Assault"
   Else:
      primaryRole = "Stealth Reconnaissance"
4. Set secondaryRole to "Direct Assault"
5. Add "Primary Role" and "Secondary Role" to operationalRoles
6. Return operationalRoles

Implementation Approach:
- Use a simple conditional or decision tree to classify roles based on speed.
- This method could be expanded to include other factors like maneuverability or engagement history for more nuanced role classification.
```

## 3. Prediction Transformation for Predictive_Trajectories

```java
Function: createPredictiveTrajectories
Input: kinematicsAnalysis (Knowledge Source)
Output: predictiveTrajectories (Knowledge Source)

1. Initialize predictiveTrajectories with the type "Predictive_Trajectories"
2. Retrieve current latitude, longitude, and speed from kinematicsAnalysis
3. Calculate future position based on current speed and a fixed time interval (e.g., 1 hour ahead):
   futureLatitude = currentLatitude + deltaLatitude(speed, time)
   futureLongitude = currentLongitude + deltaLongitude(speed, time)
4. Add "Future Position", "Speed", "Direction" to predictiveTrajectories
5. Return predictiveTrajectories

Implementation Approach:
- Implement geometric or vector calculations for positional changes.
- Consider factors like current direction and potential obstacles using a pathfinding algorithm for more accurate predictions.
```

## 4. Pattern Recognition Transformation for Behavioral_Insights

```java
Function: createBehaviouralInsights
Input: kinematicsAnalysis (Knowledge Source)
Output: behaviouralInsights (Knowledge Source)

1. Initialize behaviouralInsights with the type "Behavioural_Insights"
2. Retrieve last maneuver from kinematicsAnalysis
3. Analyze last maneuver to deduce behavioral pattern:
   If last maneuver is "High-speed turn":
      behaviorPattern = "Aggressive Maneuvering"
   Else:
      behaviorPattern = "Defensive Positioning"
4. Determine tacticalIntent based on behaviorPattern:
   If behaviorPattern is "Aggressive Maneuvering":
      tacticalIntent = "Engage Enemy Vessels"
   Else:
      tacticalIntent = "Avoid Conflict"
5. Add "Behavioral Pattern", "Tactical Intent" to behaviouralInsights
6. Return behaviouralInsights

Implementation Approach:
- Utilize machine learning or heuristic-based methods to identify patterns in movements and maneuvers.
- Train models on historical data to improve accuracy in behavior prediction and associated tactical intents.
