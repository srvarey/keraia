For example, a rule-based system might scan the cloud of knowledge to apply rules that transform the knowledge sources based on detected patterns or logical constructs.

*Example in a Naval Scenario*  
**Initial World State ($W$)**

**Cloud A** includes:
- Sonar Signal Patterns
- Vessel Types
- Speed Estimates
- Depth Readings
- Historical Contact Database
- Operational Area Map
- Allied Assets
- Threat Levels

These sources contain primarily raw or minimally processed data suitable for initial assessments.

**Transformation Function ($F$)**

**Rule-based System:** Applies rules such as:
- If sonar patterns match known enemy submarine signatures within strategic zones, classify the threat level as high.
- If allied assets are nearby and threat level is high, prepare for cooperative engagement protocols.

**New World State ($W'$)**

**Cloud B** (resulting from $F$ application on Cloud A) might include:
- Identified Objects: Known submarines or ships from sonar signals.
- Vessel Classes: Broader categories of vessel types.
- Refined Speed Profiles: Enhanced speed estimates considering environmental factors.
- 3D Positional Mapping: Combined depth and surface data.
- Predictive Behavioral Models: Expected vessel maneuvers based on historical data.
- Tactical Operation Zones: Designated areas for specific operational responses.
- Cooperative Engagement Capabilities: Joint operation strategies.
- Escalation Protocols: Detailed strategies based on updated threat levels.
