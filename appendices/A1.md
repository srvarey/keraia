| **Vortexes** | Existence_Size_Analysis, Identity_Analysis, Kinematics_Analysis |

#### Knowledge Source: `Existence_Size_Analysis (1/3)`


Description : To meticulously evaluate the presence and magnitude of specific
              components or entities in a given situation.
              In a rapidly evolving scenario, it's imperative not only
              to discern which elements are present, but also to
              gauge the scale or extent of their involvement.

#### Knowledge Source: `Identity_Analysis (2/3)`


Description : Zeroes in on accurately identifying and 
              categorizing each individual component or entity
              present in the given situation. The objective here
              isn't just to recognize the existence of elements
              but to distinctly discern their specific types,
              models, or classifications.

### Cloud of Knowledge: `Situation_Element_Contextual_Analysis`

#### Table: Cloud of Knowledge : `Situation_Element_Contextual_Analysis`

| Index | 2 / 10 (Convocation : Naval Scenario) |
|-------|---------------------------------------|

#### Knowledge Source: `Event_to_Activity_Relationships (Part 1/8)`


Description : Examines the direct interactions between entities and 
              their associated activities. It helps to understand 
              the purpose or intent behind an entity's actions or 
              its role within a broader context. 
              E.g., a naval ship (entity) conducting reconnaissance (activity).
Entity      : USS Nimitz (aircraft carrier)
Activity    : Launching aircraft
Aircraft    : F-35 Lightning II

              It offers insights into alliances, oppositions, or neutral stances. 
              E.g., the relationship between two military factions within a conflict zone.
Entity1     : USS Zumwalt (destroyer)
Entity2     : F/A-18 Hornet (aircraft)
Interaction : Air support
Region      : Atlantic Ocean


#### Knowledge Source: `Entity_to_Activity_Relationships (Part 3/8)`


Description  : Investigates the link between specific events and related activities. 
               This assists in interpreting the sequence or causality of actions  
               following an event. E.g., a diplomatic summit (event) leading to  
               increased border patrols (activity). 
               The frame outlines the direct response of an activity (activation of 
               countermeasures) resulting from an event (radio communication 
               interference).
Event        : Unexpected radio communication interference detected
