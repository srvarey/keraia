               between two or more events. It's instrumental    
               in predicting potential outcomes based on     
               historical or ongoing events. E.g., how a peace treaty       
               signing might influence subsequent diplomatic engagements.     
Event1       : Detection of an unknown submarine via sona

Description  : Studies the connections between different activities,    
               often leading to understanding sequences,    
               dependencies, or mutual exclusivities. It's crucial    
               or process mapping and understanding operational intricacies.     
               E.g., the relay between reconnaissance and strategic planning.     
Activity1    : The USS Zumwalt's anti-aircraft systems testing    
Activity2    : F/A-18 Super Hornet's mid-air refueling exercise    
Relationship : While the USS Zumwalt tests its systems,    
               the F/A-18 Super Hornet practices refueling to ensure    
               prolonged air defense capabilities. The combined activities
