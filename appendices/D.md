<noise> You sure you don’t want to eat first? I don’t mind waiting. I’ve just done it. <noise> Hold on a sec. I just have to switch the door.  <noise> <noise> Oh, do it I’ll do it as it’s Friday night. We’ll just keep it fairly short. but I just want to tell you a little story that this what the engineering then for me. And then if you can tell me if you got anything similar to that that would be a good start. And then, I can just think about it over the weekend and see what I can make of it. But yeah. He told me this story about one particular problem. I I guess it was in England but he didn’t really stay but the pump had overheated and the the reason I mean I don’t know I don’t know the reason was It the the pump in whatever installation it was was in the corner of a building and there was a vent in the wall and the the wall the the wall was next to another building. And the gap between the two buildings was about a meter wide. And everyone was using this a a rubbish dump and putting bits of wood and glass and cardboard and so they blocked up the vents and the pump overheated. Mm-hm. So, you know I mean that there’s nothing in the manual ever about a a kind of a situation like that I mean it it tell you what to do with in the case of a overheated pump maybe but you know maybe it might it might have taken someone you know 1 or 2 hours and if they’ve never come across any situation like that before I don’t know So, I I I’m just seeing if you any any story which you’ve found bemusing or was one of the most difficult things you’ve had to solve or interesting or unusual anything like that. Just Yeah so um <noise> I’ve got a bit of a catchy it’s fairly similar story. It’s um it’s a cell it’s used for um electro-chlorination so for generating chlorine or hypochlorite to to to problem disinfecting drinking water. um And they generally quite heavily installed in Scotland um because all you need to transport to them is electricity and um salt which is really safe to transport. Um whereas if it was if you were injecting hypochlorite you need to have tankers of acid moving around. Yeah, because obviously, hazardous. um So, on this unit I went to in um um Scotland um in Balmoral. And the uh the installation wasn’t great. And there were a few defects with it. And the the gassing column was low dropping down. Now in the there’s nothing in the manufacturing instructions for it. um So, let’s try to think okay well what’s causing the pressure to the air pressure to push down on this gas column? um And I sort of had to look through it and worked out that there was a a a air blockage in a a a airline coming from that unit out to the atmosphere um and blow it down and I I take there’d been about three other people to visit site and they’ve couldn’t come up with the um the solution. uh And then I left the site went away and gave them a list of recommendations. So, I got a phone call about a week later. Sorry 2 weeks later. So, the unit was going into overheat mode it was overheating um and and the the manual basically tells you to check the um the check the electrical connections. check the um incoming water is okay. And that was it. There’s nothing else in there. And we’re trying to work out what was causing it to overheat. Was it a brine issue? Was it a connection issue? Was the was the water been returned in the cell too long? Anyway, it turned out it was really sunny and the sun was hitting the the the metallic door. And because the room got no passive ventilation, it was superheating the room to 43 degrees. uh So yeah, it’s a similar sort of thing um not in the manual it’s an environmental um issue uh again on the same bit of a a cell a large cell. I want to um a call out for um <noise> United Utilities. And they’ve got so they’ve got two units that are running in tandem um so, you have two big supply tanks that supply smaller tanks and those tanks supply the units with brine which is basically just super-saturated salt water. um When I say super-saturated that just means it’s got as much salt in it as it can. um And yeah so the big tanks have got a level sensor in them to detect when there’s no solid salt in them. And an ultrasonic sensor to detect what the water level is and when to open and close a solenoid that fills a tank up. um And both units are the same but there’s no interlock between those and the operation of the cell component which is a bad idea. um So, I got called to site to look at one of the electrolyzers. I’d been I did a big service I was I worked there for 2 weeks during an overhaul. And I left. Everything was working. I got a phone call for unit number 2 was going to fault. And they couldn’t work out what it was. They couldn’t get it to work. Um I told them to do a few basic checks. So, I got there. had a look switched it on um looked at the pumps and you could see the the water in the pipes from the dosing pumps into the the cells was bouncing. It was moving up a little bit and dropping back, moving up dropping back, moving up, dropping back. um Now what the manual tells you to do is measure the specific gravity of the electrolyte uh If you measure the specific gravity of the electrolyte because they’d overdosed it with salt when they were trying to purge one of the pumps the specific gravity was too high. So, what you would normally do is reduce the um the the dose rate through the pump into the cell. um But that makes the problem worse because you will eventually the the brine will come right and then it’ll go below. And then you’ll be into a low brine in the electrolyte. um So, you sort of had to bleed the pumps. Anyway, to bleed them was to undo unions and and force the pumps to run and chase the air out of the pumps. Did that calibrated the the flows and the unit worked fine um filled them up and sort of deduced that the the the installation which was 10 years old they’d crossed the connections on the um the the bulk tanks. So in the bulk tank there’s a a level switch at the bottom that is activated by salt. In a in a saturated you have solid salt and you fill it with water and all the salt doesn’t dissolve because water can only absorb so much salt. Yeah. um And when this this float switch is down that means there’s salt in the unit so they keep adding water up into a point when the float goes up which means there’s no salt in the water which means the unit shouldn’t be used anymore. um So, what happened was site have been running low on salt and they just kept running the unit and running the unit. And the the tank number 2 was low. So, it got a shut down um No one had bothered to go and check it so that the the the tank number 2 had no salt in it. It had about 8,000 liters of water in it and a tiny amount of salt. That was all drained out and put through the unit. um And then once it got so low it air locked the the pipe work and the unit went to fault. uh And then they tried to change onto the other tank as it you know change it over. Change it over. Couldn’t get it to run. um And they couldn’t get it to run because the the the the salt tank the salt level switch in tank number 2 was cross-connected to where tank number 1 should be wired in. And number 1 was wired into number 2. So when tank number 1 had salt in it the controller thought that it had no salt in it. But really it was tank 2 that had no salt in. So they were basically adding water through tank number 2 with no salt um because someone had made a historic error 10 years ago um and they’d not uncovered it. Doesn’t someone do some basic installation checks when you’re making when you’re doing a new installation? Yeah, you’d hope so but you can’t rely on people being competent. um Because generally, the way it happens is they’ll they’ll what what wouldn’t what you you sort of think about how people would do it so if there’s two tanks to test and there’s two low-level switches to test what you probably Because you got to go out the room up the steps around the corner into the control room you would imagine that the the cable pullers pull the cables in and they’ve wrote on the cables. And the instrumentation technicians would tied them up. And then the uh uh commission engineer commission them. And you you sort of you you get to see the standard of the work and you think well, this one’s a bit lazy. So, maybe what he did was he switched both of them into fault. Went to his control panel, saw two lights okay, it’s working fine um not thinking to check them individually. um Or maybe he switched the one a light came on, he went back switched this one on and didn’t check which one was which. um It’s quite common. I mean I’ve been to commission um uh electrical chlorination plant in Ireland and there were a hundred No. There were Yeah, 1 either 100 or 98 individual wires um from about 12 different cables. uh And they’re all control cables and none of them are labeled. and every single one was in the wrong place. And this company had paid me and two other engineers to to come from Germany and me for a week to commission this plant and they were supposed to have done all these checks. And it was a 7.5 million quid plant and they hadn’t even put the right wires in the right holes. Um So, yeah people should do checks but they don’t. um And And just can’t rely on people so we’ll check that I mean they’ll outsource that to someone or whoever sold the the the components or who who sold it. Yes so that’s the the Grand Forks would have been asked tasked with designing the system supplying the units and then commissioning the units and someone else would have delivered them to site. installed them and had done the the like pre-readiness checks in accordance with the drawings. um And they obviously didn’t do them very well. um On that site we’ve actually got to go back and do a large amount of remedial work because there was some ventilation pipe work um and the initial design basically the pipe work came up about half a meter and went along 3 meters and out the wall. uh Unfortunately, that wasn’t aesthetically pleasing enough to the um contractors employer. So, they increase the pipe length by 12 meters and and put a 6 m vertical piece in. which exceeded the capacity of the fan to lift liquid. um Yeah, well so I went to site to go and they kept complaining that the units were locking out and they were getting faults and there was all sorts of stuff. um And And the the so the manufacturing plant in Germany so said oh, no it’s not the um it’s not our uh equipment. It’s We didn’t want It doesn’t make sense. The you can’t be getting condensation in the hoses it it surely it just push it out. So, well it’s a long way to push it and you’re we’re getting you’ve got a curly hose in a straight pipe so it’s naturally going to have peaks and troughs. No, no no. Of course, it won’t it will lay flat. So, well We won’t it’ll never lay flat. if it’s coiled then you move it it’s still going to be coiled. um And I went to a job for Bristol Water and they used clear pipes. So, you could see the hoses and check for liquid inside it on their installations. So, I re-simulated the problem we got in Ireland and took some videos. And basically said well, this is the problem and this is how we need to fix it. um But again that’s not covered in the manual and the um the the experts or the manufacturing plant didn’t believe it could happen either. um But uh I mean on on pumps because I mean that that’s a that’s chlorination equipment on pumps, one of the ones would be um pump some the new um <noise> pump one of my new circulators. The the pump if the pump can’t turn it will come up with pump blocked. uh So, your first move is to take the pump out, turn it upside down. Check it’s not blocked. Check it’s been free, freely. um And then the next recommendation is to replace the terminal box and the motor which is quite expensive. um But if you look at it in a a slightly different way from an older an old motor design um it could be that one of the one of the power phases is missing. um So, if you check those and you you work out you’re missing a phase that will well that’s remedied the problem on about four occasions for me rather than replacing the um motor and pump uh Motor inverter, sorry. uh And that’s not covered in the manual at all. The The unit says pump blocked and it basically stays, check the pump’s not blocked. uh But the reason the pump thinks it’s blocked is because it it tries to turn realises it’s pulling too much current on one of the phases and stops. But it’s trying to pull too much current on one of the phases because one of the other phases is missing. um So, that’s why it’s pulling more current. um And it’s a Yeah, it’s an interesting one that you sort of you you do see occasionally and installers have installed them and they’ve not a they’ve not installed them properly or b they’ve um missed a phase. um Again, another pump with missing phases was for a uh urgent call out. I went to the job and they were going to replace 1 2 3 4 5 6 pumps. um So, four of them they said were seized and weren’t working and and wouldn’t move. And then they’re they’re taking these out already at this point and there were two that were still installed and I got there and I said what’s wrong with the pumps? And he said they don’t work they they’re just humming. All right, okay they’re just humming, that means that the the rotor is oscillating in the state in the stator. um And it means you’re missing a phase. How’d you mean? So, you you you obviously missing a phase to break the magnetic field to make it rotate, it’s just jumping between two poles at the minute. um So, tested the electric and low and behold they were missing L2. Opened up the panel and someone had modified the electrics to take L2 from a no they’d taken an L3 up to the gas valve and left the old connection to L2 in, which blew the fuse on L2. um And wiped out L2 out for the whole plant room. uh And And then so basically, told them what was wrong. Rectified the wiring in the control panel. Tested the pumps and low and behold the pumps they were going to replace worked. And when they put the the other two pumps in which was like two sets of two. um they worked as well. So, they probably saved around about 15,000 pounds plus labour. um Obviously, Grand Forks lost out on that sale. But it’s more about becoming a um you know trusted uh partner with a customer then constantly being on the take. um <noise> What’s that for? It’s just I’ve got this PDF. Have you Have you got this document? It’s 2 it’s a it’s a PDF document, it’s 277 pages long. It’s called Root Cause Failure Analysis. Oh, right. Have you heard of it or did you know about it? Yeah, Root Cause Failure um We We have something called We use something called FADE. Which is a Failure Analysis system um But Root Cause Failure I can’t I’ve got I’ve heard about it. Never read it. um Published by Electrical Apparatus Service Association. <noise> So, so just how I I’ve interest how are you going to um <noise> I was just going to look at how you going to use this story to e- you’re looking to find the intelligence that Like the um the articulation around telling the story is the intelligence or or how the intelligence was gathered you know how you gathered those that information that led you to that unusual part of the the problem? I I think I mentioned it. what interests me a lot is is something called reasoning by analogy. So, Yeah. I don’t know if I if I told you to have a look have to watch this YouTube video. In 35 years, it’s the most interesting video I’ve seen on AI. It’s on YouTube. It’s called um <noise> It’s by Douglas Hofstadter. The who um uh what was it called? Reasoning the Court. I’ll I’ll send you the link you you can have a look at it. You’ll notice that I but It’s basically what he’s saying is that everything we do every single day all day long when we when we’re trying to solve problems, what we’re doing is is pulling up analogies you know these things that are either directly similar to what we’ve done in the past or we can kind of do a kind of a I don’t know what you call it? Do you call it a parallel comparison sort of thing? a kind of a a similar problem in a parallel universe?  Now, Yeah, well it it it’d be like oh well if if my heating pipe didn’t work my heating pump my heating system didn’t work because there wasn’t enough flow and then you think well it wasn’t enough flow because there was a restriction and then you can sort of make that jump between flow and pressure and voltage and current. Yeah. you know if you’re if you’re looking at a a cable and you think well hang on why am I getting why am I not getting enough current? Well hang on there’s a big pressure drop so pressure is the equivalent of voltage. So right, there must be something causing a squeeze on the cable like that pipe was squeezed. um And then you have a look and it’s oh the cable’s been bent. And that’s like a perfect sort of completely opposite completely different um parameters but almost perfectly parallel um uh um analogy. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. Now, that’s exactly what I’m trying to do so I mean I’ve got some All right. I’m halfway I mean I’ve I’ve written a lot of code. I mean I’m but if I worked full time it would probably take me another week to finish it but I started off using  t- getting hold of a list system that was written about 30 years ago and it was to the the systems called um SWALE. And this is based on um It’s a it’s based on a um a famous racehorse in America who died mysteriously. So, when the Kentucky Derby, he was about 3 years old and then a few days after, he just dropped dead and they couldn’t they could not find any reason. Until they built this program to try and fact to try and do some reasoning about anomalies. But um well But I mean that’s really interesting in in in in and of itself, but the the the pro this program and every other program that uses ontologists is based on the assumption that everything you need to know you can find out by kind of navigating a class hierarchy. So, or you know if a if a pump’s part of this family needs to solve the problem for this family of pumps then But that that’s just one one relationship and this a super-class relationship but what I’ve done is to implement inheritance along any kind of relationship. And I’ll I’ll just I’ll give you an example from Yeah. well that makes perfect sense. That we remember we were discussing something similar like you said with with that where you’ve got like a a a um Yeah, there was a very clear map but the map didn’t include some of the processes you needed to do. And it was so okay. Well, I’m trying to I’m I’m I’m trying to think of a second example. So, I’ve always quoted one example over the years and now I need to think of this kind of three or four more examples where it it makes sense to reason like this but this came from when I was working for the Royal Navy, so, if you think about So, you’ve got you’ve got two you’ve got helicopters and you’ve got aircraft carriers. And Yep. independently they’ve both got a property called speed. But Yeah. But so, when the helicopter’s flying, it speed is like could be 200 knots and the ship speed is 20 knots. But when the helicopter’s landed on the aircraft carrier the speed of the helicopter is it is actually the speed of the ship because it’s stationary to the ship. So, you’re inhe You’re You’re inheriting the value of speed through this relationship called on platform. And no one like in 30 years, I’ve never seen anyone implement that and I I I I I mean I did that years ago, but it’s I’ve kind of brought things up to date in in my job program and I’m using Neo4j as a back end but this is what I’m implementing. So, this SWALE system works on just a a abstraction just super-class abstractions, so it tries to fit it it uses I’ve mentioned this before something called frames by Marvin Minsky. So, it tries to fill in missing slots. And if you can’t find a value for a slot which is a property it it it asks the question well, what is it an abstraction of? And then tries to find any value in a a in a in the slot and abstraction, but this relationship is just this super-class relationship. Right. And my my hypothesis is that it’d be much more useful if you can say well, I actually, this information comes from this this association. And it’s got nothing to do with structure. It’s just it’s just some temporal dynamic relationship in place that causing it to you know my behavior is affected because of this temporal relationship with this other objects. So, I’m just trying to think of other examples like this. Helicopter and ship speed. um That Yeah. So, that that’s that that’s how I’m doing reasoning by analogy. I’m trying to I’m trying to navigate or look at all all relations. And see if there’s any anything interesting that could you know be relevant to what I’m trying to solve but in a different domain. Yeah, so just go through that. I’m I’m just trying to clear how the to the the the just a helicopter to thing, so I can work out what the the frame is. So, what was the the problem, what was the problem that you’re trying to solve with the helicopters and the ship?  Well, I wasn’t trying to solve a problem. It was just a It was just trying to illustrate the fact that you can in in in all the textbooks people are when people talk about inheritance of properties it’s always through this super-class relationship. And And I I I said to myself well, hold on this isn’t the only relationship where you can inherit information from Yeah. not the one I just told you about is the naive example of that but I need to find a lot more examples like that, you know real world examples. And then because that’s how you do reasoning by analogy. You think okay, well in this in this kind of small world we have these objects and these relationships. And then we have a parallel universe or a a different world and you’re not you’re not trying to do I mean there are algorithms to do like graph matching, but I’m not I’m not interested in structure. I’m more interested in the in the semantic associations between objects in one world and objects in another world. Yeah. So, the the uh I’m I’m just trying to think So, the the the the electricity and and and flow on I mean They They’re both Well, that’s a good that’s a good example. I mean if you listen to this YouTube video by Hofstadter, the Yeah. He says the the second So, Einstein’s known for his first discovery. E equals mc². But he he was also famous for something else and I forgot what it was. But he said Platonic The reason I I did made this discovery was I was thinking about another problem in a completely different world. And then I thought hold on, that that would work in this in this world. And that’s that’s how it caused that problem. And the Hofstadter is uh uh And kind of whole reasoning texture is that this is how everybody thinks every day in their whole life every single day. It’s how you think. You just remember past occurrences and just Well, yeah it’s like when you kind of get a um <noise> I don’t know when you’re trying to prize a a um <noise> So the really basic, you do you’re trying to open a tin of golden syrup. And you look at it. You’re thinking well, how the heck am I going to do this? um It’s not uh you know where do you put your fingers in? How do you open it? And then you remember that you’ve you’ve opened the tin of paint with the screwdriver. And then you look at a a a spoon and the tin of golden syrup and realise that the spoon will do the same job as being a lever to get the lid out. But a screwdriver wouldn’t on a tin of paint. Yeah. Yeah. This is a bit Can you can you see that that chat message?  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  <noise>  


## Initial Scenarios

The narrative explains several troubleshooting scenarios with pumps and other installations. While it does not translate directly into Clara rules, it can be used to identify the thought process behind diagnosing and fixing issues. Here are the implied rules in the form of actions within their corresponding scenarios:

### Scenario: Pump Overheating due to Blocked Vent
1. Identify the initial problem (In this case pump overheating).
2. Analyze the installation to identify the cause (The pump location, proximity to a vent and the condition of the vent).
3. Identify any external factors contributing to the problem (A nearby rubbish dump blocking the vent).
4. Rectify the problem by removing blockages and ensuring the vent is clear to prevent overheating.

### Scenario: Electro-chlorination Unit Overheating
1. Identify the issue (Overheating unit).
2. Inspect the installation and any defects (The gassing column dropping).
3. Investigate underlying causes (Air blockage in an airline from the unit).
4. Make recommendations for fixing issues.
5. Investigate any recurrent issues (The unit going into overheat mode again).
6. Check if there are any environmental reasons contributing to the overheating (The sun hitting a metallic door and room lacking passive ventilation).

### Scenario: Incorrectly Wired Salt Tanks
1. Identify the problem of the electrolyzers failing to operate despite correct checks and procedures.
2. Physically inspect the units and its behaviours.
3. Refer to previous experience and make parallels (Just as a heating pump didn’t work due to a squeezed pipe affecting flow, a cable bent severely could be restricting current).
4. Rectify the issue based on the derived analogy (Checking for phase loss in the pumps).

These scenarios demonstrate the potential of reasoning by analogy in problem-solving, suggesting that AI rules could be developed to mimic this thought process.
